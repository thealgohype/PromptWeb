## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. For the prompt generation, we will use the GPT-3 model from OpenAI. The application will be containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment. The frontend will be built using ReactJS, a popular open-source JavaScript library. For compatibility, we will ensure that the application can be run on popular operating systems like Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Python package name

## Data structures and interface definitions


    classDiagram
        class PromptGPT{
            +str user_prompt
            +str optimized_prompt
            +generate_prompt(user_prompt: str): str
        }
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant U as User
        participant P as PromptGPT
        U->>P: Input user_prompt
        P->>P: generate_prompt(user_prompt)
        P-->>U: Return optimized_prompt
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
