## Full API spec


        openapi: 3.0.0
        info:
          title: PromptGPT API
          version: 1.0.0
        paths:
          /generate:
            post:
              summary: Generate optimized prompt
              requestBody:
                required: true
                content:
                  application/json:
                    schema:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                        user_prompt:
                          type: string
              responses:
                '200':
                  description: A JSON object containing the optimized prompt
                  content:
                    application/json:
                      schema:
                        type: object
                        properties:
                          optimized_prompt:
                            type: string
    

## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Contains the main entry of the application, initializes Flask app, and sets up the route for the API.']
- ['PromptGPT.py', "Contains the PromptGPT class and its methods. The 'generate_prompt' method should be implemented first as it is the core functionality."]
- ['App.js', 'Contains the ReactJS code for the frontend. It should interact with the Flask API to send user prompts and receive optimized prompts.']

## Task list

- PromptGPT.py
- main.py
- App.js
- Dockerfile
- requirements.txt
- README.md

## Shared Knowledge


        'PromptGPT.py' contains the class 'PromptGPT' which has two attributes: 'user_prompt' and 'optimized_prompt'. It has a method 'generate_prompt' which takes 'user_prompt' as input and returns 'optimized_prompt'.
        'main.py' is the main entry of the application. It initializes the Flask app and sets up the route for the API.
        'App.js' contains the ReactJS code for the frontend. It interacts with the Flask API to send user prompts and receive optimized prompts.
        'Dockerfile' is used to containerize the application for easy setup and deployment.
        'requirements.txt' contains the list of required Python third-party packages.
        'README.md' provides the instructions on how to setup and run the application.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
