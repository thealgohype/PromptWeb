## Original Requirements

Create an extensive chatGPT plugin for prompt engineering called PROMPTGPT. This plugin should take in any user's prompt and output the best prompt according to the principles of prompt engineering. Detailed instructions on how to run and set it up should be included in the readme.md file.

## Product Goals

- Develop a user-friendly interface for inputting prompts
- Ensure the plugin generates the most effective prompts based on input
- Provide clear and concise instructions for setup and use

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to input my prompt and get the most effective version of it
- As a user, I want to easily install and setup the plugin
- As a user, I want to understand how the plugin works and how to use it effectively
- As a user, I want the plugin to be compatible with my current software
- As a user, I want the plugin to generate prompts quickly

## Competitive Analysis

## Requirement Pool

- ['Develop a user-friendly interface', 'P0']
- ['Implement effective prompt generation algorithm', 'P0']
- ['Write detailed instructions for setup and use', 'P0']
- ['Ensure compatibility with various software', 'P1']
- ['Optimize the prompt generation speed', 'P1']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be minimalistic with a single input field for the user's prompt. The output field should display the generated prompt. The setup and usage instructions should be accessible through a 'Help' button. The layout should be clean and intuitive.

## Anything UNCLEAR
